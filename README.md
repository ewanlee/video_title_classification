This project is developed under python2, Ubuntu Server 16.04 and use one
GPX 1080 Ti card.

Notice that the word2vec model file do not upload to this repository because of
Github upload limits.
You can find the model file at [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o89R8Oa)

I use three model:
- TextCNN
- TextRNN
- TextRCNN

For now, I get the best multi-class classification accuracy bt use TextCNN. The
hyperparameters are write in code.
